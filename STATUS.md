# Project Status

**Created:** December 27, 2025
**Phase:** Genesis - collaboration proposed, not yet begun

## Origin

Jong-Bok Kim proposed collaboration after responding to definiteness/deitality questions:

> "Another thing -- one more thing I really want to work on more is 'transparent free relative clauses', which you could find from my form-function book. I attach only this part here. I have been wondering about various functions of 'what' in English from diachronic and synchronic perspectives. As you recognize, 'what' is one of the most tricky expressions in English. Somehow, the corresponding expression in Japanese (koto or no) and Korean (kes) is also really intriguing.
>
> It would be really great if we two can work on this topic together:-)"

## Next Steps

- [ ] Read Kim's TFR chapter (attached to Dec 27 email)
- [ ] Send Kim the whose relatives draft (`Independent_relative_whose/Reynolds_7.15.25-2.pdf`)
- [ ] Reply to Kim expressing interest / scoping the collaboration
- [ ] Identify what Kim has already written vs. what's open ground

## Division of Labour (TBD)

- **Kim:** SBCG formalization, Korean/Japanese data, existing TFR analysis
- **Reynolds:** HPC framing (?), English diachrony (?), experimental angle (?)

## Open Questions

- Is this a joint paper or a joint project with multiple outputs?
- What's the target venue?
- How does this connect to the whose project? (both involve non-standard relatives)
