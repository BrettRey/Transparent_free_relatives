## What are Transparent Free Relatives?

Standard free relatives (FRs) hide their internal structure from external syntax:

- *I'll eat [what you're having].* - "what you're having" acts as NP externally
- *I'll go [wherever you go].* - "wherever you go" acts as PP/AdvP externally

**Transparent** FRs let internal structure "show through":

- *What the Republicans are doing is [an/∅] attack on democracy.*
  - The internal predicate nominal ("attack on democracy") determines external agreement/determination

Kim's interest: How does SBCG/HPSG model this transparency? What constraints allow internal features to percolate?

## The "What" Problem

"What" is multifunctional:

| Construction | Example | Category |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Interrogative | *What did you see?* | Interrogative pronoun |
| Free relative | *I'll take what you're offering.* | Fused relative |
| Exclamative | *What a mess!* | Exclamative determinative |
| Cleft | *What I need is coffee.* | Relativizer (?) |
| Echo | *You saw what?* | In-situ interrogative |

**Diachronic question:** Did these uses develop from a common source? What's the grammaticalization path?

**Cross-linguistic question:** Korean *kes* and Japanese *koto*/*no* seem to play similar roles. Are the parallels coincidental or structural?

## Potential HPC Angle

If the category "free relative" (or "what-clause") is an HPC:
- What properties cluster?
- What mechanisms maintain the cluster?
- How do TFRs fit? (boundary case? separate cluster? overlapping?)

This could connect to the whose project's analysis of non-standard relatives.

## Cross-Project Connections

### Independent relative *whose* (`Independent_relative_whose/`)

Both projects deal with **non-standard relative constructions**:
- *Whose* relatives: fused relative with possessive internal structure
- TFRs: fused relatives where internal predicate structure becomes externally visible

**Shared puzzle:** In both cases, something "inside" the relative clause affects something "outside":
- *Whose*: the antecedent is internal (fused into *whose*)
- TFR: the internal predicate determines external agreement/determination

**Potential unified analysis:** Both may involve feature percolation from internal to external positions - Kim's SBCG machinery could model this.

### Definiteness/Deitality (`HPC book/chapters/chapter10.tex`)

Kim's feature geometry separates:
- SYN[DEITALITY [DEIXIS, DET-TYPE, HOSTING]]
- SEM[DEFINITENESS [IDENT, UNIQ, FAM]]

**Application to TFRs:**
- "What" in FRs has determiner-like behavior (introduces NP)
- TFR transparency may involve DEIXIS or DET-TYPE features being accessible externally
- Definiteness of the FR depends on internal structure (definite vs. indefinite predicate)

### Countability (`countability/`)

Kim noted: "these features would be relevant only on phrasal level expressions, determined by context. For instance, 'He is an Einstein', the proper noun is converted as a countable one."

**Parallel:** TFR transparency is also a phrasal phenomenon - the internal predicate's properties (countability, definiteness) become visible at the phrase level.

### Lexical Categories (`HPC book/chapters/chapter11.tex`)

"What" is a **lexical category puzzle**:
- Interrogative pronoun: *What did you see?*
- Fused relative: *I'll eat what you're having.*
- Exclamative: *What a mess!*
- ??? in TFRs

Is "what" one category or several? This connects to the HPC book's question about whether lexical categories are unified or cluster-based.

### Grammaticality (`Grammaticality_de_idealized/`)

Kim admitted: "licensing-based theory has no clear distinction between well-formed ones and those with ? or ??"

**Application:** TFRs may show **gradient acceptability** based on internal/external feature match:
- Perfect match (internal predicate = expected external category) → fully acceptable
- Partial match → marginal
- Mismatch → degraded

This could be empirical evidence for the MMMG-style gradient grammaticality model.
